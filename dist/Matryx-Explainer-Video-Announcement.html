<h1>Matryx Platform Aims to Breakthrough Barriers Impeding STEM Innovations
</h1>
<p>Blockchain-based bounty system incentivizes collaborative problem solving</p>

<article>
<p>
  SAN DIEGO, Calif. – September 5, 2017 – Matryx, an open source platform for decentralized collaboration, is pairing virtual reality and blockchain technologies to provide an ecosystem for collaborative problem solving across fields like science, technology, engineering and math (STEM).
</p> 
<p>
  Technologies like the printing press, postal service, telephone and internet have enabled global collaboration and connectivity for hundreds of years. However, despite these advancements, there still lacks a unified ecosystem for transparent and effective collaboration. Duplication and fragmented efforts lead to time and money lost. In addition, many critical contributors to breakthroughs are overshadowed by the few who reveal work to the public in its final stages. By creating a visual, collaborative and public think tank, Matryx ensures that recognition is rightfully given to all contributors of a given solution, thereby encouraging and incentivizing innovation at every level.
</p>
<p>
  “The history of innovation points towards a clear future: a world where science, research and collaboration occur on a blockchain,” said Steve McCloskey, CEO, Matryx. “We believe that Matryx is this future. It will make problem solving a collective experience where all contributors are recognized for providing a critical building block towards a given solution; and it will speed the rate by which that given solution is found.”

  Matryx consists of a library, marketplace, and bounty system for unique problems and their creative solutions. The Matryx Marketplace allows direct value exchange between users, allowing anyone to buy, sell or exchange digital assets for use in their designs for research or use in their digital worlds. Matryx uses an ERC20 token, MTX, for the exchange of ideas and the Matryx bounty system.
