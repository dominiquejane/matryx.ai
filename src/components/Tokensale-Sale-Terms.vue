      <li class="c32"><span class="c2">Risk of Losing Access to MTX Due to Wallet Incompatibility: </span><span class="c0">A valid ERC20 Ethereum address from an ERC20 compatible wallet like Parity, Mist, MyEtherWallet, or Metamask is required to receive your MTX because your MTX will be delivered to this address. Non-ERC20 compatible wallet addresses will not be accepted. &nbsp;In addition, the Ethereum address used must not be associated with a third party exchange or service that has custody over the private key. &nbsp;You must own the private key if your address is an exchange address. &nbsp;</span></li>
      <li class="c19"><span class="c2">Risks Associated with the Ethereum Protocol: </span><span class="c0">MTX and the Matryx platform are based on the Ethereum protocol. As such, any malfunction, unintended function, unexpected functioning of or attack on the Ethereum protocol may cause the Matryx platform or MTX to malfunction or function in an unexpected or unintended manner. Ether, the native unit of account of the Ethereum protocol, may itself lose value in ways similar to MTX, and also other ways.</span></li>
      <li class="c19"><span class="c2">Risks Associated with Purchaser Credentials: </span><span class="c0">Any third party that gains access to or learns of your wallet login credentials or private keys may be able to dispose of your MTX. To minimize this risk, you should guard against unauthorized access to your electronic devices.. Best practices dictate that you safely store private keys in one or more backup locations geographically separated from the working location. &nbsp;In addition, you are responsible for giving us the correct address to send you your MTX. &nbsp;If you give us the incorrect address to send your MTX to, we are not responsible for any loss of MTX that may occur.</span></li>
      <li class="c20"><span class="c2">Risk of Unfavorable Regulatory Action in One or More Jurisdictions: </span><span class="c0">&nbsp;Blockchain technologies and token sales have been the subject of scrutiny by various regulatory bodies around the world. The functioning of the Matryx platform and MTX could be impacted by one or more regulatory inquiries or actions, including the licensing of or restrictions on the use, sale, or possession of digital tokens like MTX, which could impede, limit or end the development of the Matryx platform and increase legal costs.</span></li>
      <li class="c19"><span class="c2">Risk of Alternative, Unofficial Matryx platform: </span><span class="c0">Following the Token Issuance Program and the development of the initial version of the MTX platform, it is possible that alternative applications could be established, which use the same open source code and protocol underlying the Matryx platform. The official Matryx platform may compete with these alternative, unofficial MTX-based applications, which could potentially negatively impact the Matryx platform and MTX, including its value.</span></li>

    <ol class="c1 lst-kix_list_16-0" start="6">
      <li class="c52"><span class="c15">Risk of Insufficient Interest in the Matryx platform or Distributed Applications: </span><span class="c0">It is possible that the Matryx platform will not be used by a large number of businesses, individuals, and other organizations and that there will be limited public interest in the creation and development of distributed applications. Such a lack of interest could negatively impact MTX and the Matryx platform.</span></li>
      <li class="c22"><span class="c2">Risk that the Matryx platform, As Developed, Will Not Meet the Expectations of Matryx or the Purchaser: </span><span class="c0">The Matryx platform is presently under development and may undergo significant changes before release. Any expectations or assumptions regarding the form and functionality of the Matryx platform or MTX (including participant behavior) held by Matryx or the purchaser may not be met upon release, for any number of reasons including mistaken assumptions or analysis, a change in the design and implementation plans and execution of the Matryx platform.</span></li>
      <li class="c22"><span class="c2">Risk of Unfavorable Fluctuation of Ether and Other Currency Value: </span><span class="c0">The Company team correctly intends to use the proceeds from selling MTX to fund the maintenance and development of the Matryx platform, as described further in the White Paper. The proceeds of the Token Issuance Program will be denominated in Ether, and converted into other cryptographic and fiat currencies. If the value of Ether or other currencies fluctuates unfavorably during or after the Token Issuance Program, the Company team may not be able to fund development, or may not be able to develop or maintain the Matryx platform in the manner that it intended.</span></li>
      <li class="c22"><span class="c2">Risks from Taxation: </span><span class="c0">The tax characterization of MTX is uncertain. You must seek your own tax advice in connection with purchasing MTX, which may result in adverse tax consequences to you, including withholding taxes, income taxes, and tax reporting requirements.</span></li>
      <li class="c5"><span class="c2">Risk of Theft and Hacking: </span><span class="c0">Hackers or other groups or organizations or countries may attempt to interfere with the Matryx platform or the availability of MTX in any number of ways, including service attacks, Sybil attacks, spoofing, smurfing malware attacks, or consensus based attacks, or phishing, or other novel methods that may or may not be known to steal Tokens.</span></li>
      <li class="c5"><span class="c2">Risk of Security Weaknesses in the Matryx platform Core Infrastructure Software: </span><span class="c0">The Matryx platform consists of open source software that is based on other open source software. There is a risk that the Matryx team, or other third parties may intentionally or unintentionally introduce weaknesses or bugs into the core infrastructural elements of the Matryx platform interfering with the use of or causing the loss of MTX.</span></li>
    </ol>
    <p class="c36 c13"><span class="c16 c44"></span></p>
    <ol class="c1 lst-kix_list_16-0" start="12">
      <li class="c6"><span class="c15">Risk of Weaknesses or Exploitable Breakthroughs in the Field of Cryptography: </span><span class="c0">Advances in cryptography, or technical advances such as the development of quantum computers, could present risks to cryptocurrencies and the Matryx platform, which could result in the theft or loss of MTX.</span></li>
      <li class="c5"><span class="c2">Risk of MTX Mining Attacks: </span><span class="c0">As with other decentralized cryptographic tokens and cryptocurrencies, the blockchain used for the Matryx platform is susceptible to mining attacks, including double-spend attacks, majority mining power attacks, selfish-mining attacks, and race condition attacks. Any successful attacks present a risk to the Matryx platform, MTX, and expected proper execution and sequencing of Ethereum contract computations. &nbsp;Despite the efforts of the Matryx team, the risk of known or novel mining attacks exists.</span></li>
      <li class="c5"><span class="c2">Risk of Lack of Adoption or Use of the Matryx platform: </span><span class="c0">While MTX should not be viewed as an investment, it may have value over time. That value may be limited or non-existent if the Matryx platform lacks use and adoption. If this becomes the case, there may be few or no markets following the launch of the platform, potentially having an adverse impact on MTX.</span></li>
      <li class="c23"><span class="c2">Risk of an Illiquid Market for MTX: </span><span class="c0">The Company is not aware of any a marketplace for MTX and there may never be any such marketplace for MTX. There are currently no exchanges upon which MTX would trade. If ever exchanges do develop, they will likely be relatively new and subject to poorly understood regulatory oversight. They may therefore be more exposed to fraud and failure than established, regulated exchanges for other products and have a negative impact on MTX.</span></li>
      <li class="c23"><span class="c2">Risk of Uninsured Losses: </span><span class="c0">Unlike bank accounts or accounts at some other financial institutions, funds held using the Matryx platform or Ethereum network are generally uninsured. In the event of any loss, there is no public insurer, such as the FDIC, or private insurer, to offer recourse to the purchaser.</span></li>
      <li class="c5"><span class="c2">Risk of Dissolution of the Matryx Project: </span><span class="c0">It is possible that, due to any number of reasons, including an unfavorable fluctuation in the value of Ether, development issues with the Matryx platform, the failure of business relationships, or competing intellectual property claims, the Matryx project may no longer be viable as a business or otherwise and may dissolve or fail to launch.</span></li>
      <li class="c5"><span class="c15">Risk of Malfunction in the Matryx platform: </span><span class="c0">It is possible that the Matryx platform malfunctions in an unfavorable way, including one that results in the loss of MTX.</span></li>

      <li class="c6"><span class="c2">Unanticipated Risks: </span><span class="c0">Cryptographic tokens are a new and untested technology. In addition to the risks discussed in the White Paper and these Terms, there are risks that the Matryx team cannot anticipate. Further risks may materialize as unanticipated combinations or variations of the discussed risks or the emergence of new risks.</span></li>
